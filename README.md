# ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

> &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; **If updating from a version prior to 2023-06-18**: Many of the nodes have been renamed to include `pysssss` to prevent conflicts with other nodes. If you get missing nodes, please replace them with the new names.

> &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; **Auto installation process is still a new feature in need of testing, if you have any problems please log an issue**

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts.git`  
to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory

   The script will then automatically install all custom scripts and nodes.  
   It will attempt to use symlinks and junctions to prevent having to copy files and keep them up to date.

- For uninstallation:
  - Delete the cloned repo in `custom_nodes`
  - Ensure `web/extensions/pysssss/CustomScripts` has also been removed

# Update
1. Navigate to the cloned repo e.g. `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts`
2. `git pull`
